## Project Summary

Our project features a user-friendly interface where travelers can effortlessly plan their trips, go on spontaneous adventures with a randomly generated itinerary, or compare transportation prices. The "Plan Your Trip" page enables users to easily select their starting and ending destinations, desired departure time, and receive a comprehensive list of stops, transfers, and ride details, including timings and cost. The "Explore" page offers a thrilling twist with an automatically generated trip starting from the user's selected location.

Our project also features a "Financial" page, offering an in-depth look at the cost of different trip options between destinations. This page may be a significant or minor part of the project, depending on the feasibility of implementation. Our aim is to provide the cheapest route to the destination, but this will depend on the availability of sufficient data. If feasible, we'll use weighted graph algorithms to determine the best route. At the very minimum, we'll strive to provide the most cost-effective direct routes from your location, ranking transportation options from least most expensive.
